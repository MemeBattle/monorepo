## How it all began

In 2017, a group of students from Novosibirsk State Technical University teamed up to participate in an online hackathon.
The hackathon was dedicated entertainment and fun. We created an application (web and Android) with an endless battle of memes. Every few seconds, users saw a pair of memes and voted for one of them.
Players who rated the meme with a majority vote received the internal currency â€“ MemeCoin.
We won that hackathon and received investments for development.

</Details>

After that, we participated in hackathons for several years. Local hackathons in Siberia (Tomsk, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk) and large ones in Moscow. It was our hobby.
Meanwhile, we periodically returned to the original idea, but never created a real product ðŸ˜¢

In parallel with hackathons, we have done some educational projects. For example, in union with other students, owe organized the AVTF IT community â€“ several meetups by different streams (web development, mobile development, databases, information security, data science). For you to know, our first meetup brought together more than 150 people!

We often discussed MemeBattle and told our friends about it. But we have not been able to answer the question "What is MemeBattle". We usually answer like this:
> MemeBattle is not a dot on a map. MemeBattle is people.

Looking back, I can answer:
><b>MemeBattle</b> is a small community built around several technical projects that we have used to explore new technologies and approaches. <br /> It is also a team that we created to participate in hackathons and other activities.

## MemeBattle today

The original concept of the application focused on meme battles is a thing of the past.

At the moment, MemeBattle is primarily an <b>open community</b> united by common projects.
We are open to new ideas and projects and are happy to invite everyone to join us.

To date, MemeBattle has several projects in development.

### Ligretto

<b>Ligretto</b> is fast-paced online multiplayer game in which you need to lay out cards as quickly as possible and outperform your opponents with reaction and agility.

Play with friends at any time - one round takes only a few minutes. Our colleagues sometimes spend their free time like this between meetings ðŸ˜„

### GameHub

<b>GameHub</b> is online games service. Unfortunately, there is only one game so far. But in the ideal future, it will be a portal for multiple online games in one ecosystem.

We are witnessing a profound transformation in people's lives. The world is becoming global and remote.
In the past, we used to have the chance to effortlessly gather with friends or colleagues at a party or in the office, enjoy ourselves, and engage in board games.

Nowadays, many companies are scattered around the world, making it more difficult to gather around one table.
GameHub and games within it can facilitate spending time together by playing.

### Blog

This blog. There will be not only news from the MemeBattle team, but also various posts from everyone.
First of all, we would like to share technical discoveries and experiences. For example, one of the following posts is planned as a description of using variable fonts research in this blog.

### MemeBattle as PaaS

All our projects deployed to self infrastructure on AWS. We have well-established practices and solutions for quickly launching services into production.

### Education

We continue to use our projects for education. New technologies, tools, approaches etc.

> It's better to try something on real-like projects than to read about it a thousand times.

#### Experience

Here you can practice solving problems like on real-life projects. For example, [add localization system to Ligretto](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/issues/177), so that the language barrier doesn't spoil the gaming experience.
Or add new features like [leaderboard in Ligretto](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/milestone/11).

There are also smaller tasks that help newcomers take their [first steps](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/labels/good%20first%20issue).

The experience gained on our projects constantly helps me in interviews and in my work.
And since our repositories are open and projects are publicly accessible, every member of the community has tangible evidence of their experience.

#### Mentoring

Furthermore, I believe that MemeBattle projects provide a solid infrastructure for mentoring.

We are always eager to assist everyone, and if you are a mentor or a buddy, we can support you with tasks. After all, collaborating on a project with others is much more enjoyable than working in isolation.

## Summary

MemeBattle is projects, technical and education platform, team and community. Together we learn new things in practice, and our main resource is people.
