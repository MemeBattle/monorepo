## How it all began

In 2017, a group of students from Novosibirsk State Technical University teamed up to participate in an online hackathon.
The hackathon was about entertainment and fun. We created an application (web and Android) with an infinity battle of memes. Every few seconds users saw a pair of memes and voted for one of them.
Players who rated the meme with a majority vote received the internal currency â€“ MemeCoin.
We won that hackathon and received investments for development.

</details>

After that we have participated in hackathons several years. Local hackathons in Siberia (Tomsk, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk) and grand ones in Moscow â€“ it was our hobby.
Meanwhile, we periodically returned to the original idea, but didn't create real product ðŸ˜¢

In parallel with hackathons we have done some education projects. For example, in union with other students, organized IT community AVTF â€“ few meetups by different streams (web development, mobile development, databases, information security, data science). Just so you know, on the first meetup were more than 150 people!

We often discussed about MemeBattle and told to friend. But we could never answer the question "What is MemeBattle". Usually we respond like:
> MemeBattle â€“ is not a dot on a map. MemeBattle â€“ is people.

Looking back, I can answer:
><b>MemeBattle</b> â€“ small community around few technical projects, where we studied new technologies and approaches. <br /> Also this is the team with which we participated in hackathons and other activities.

## MemeBattle today

The initial concept of an application centered around battle of memes is a thing of the past.

At the moment MemeBattle is primarily an <b>open community</b> united by common projects.
We are open to new ideas and projects, also we invite everyone to join us.

There are few projects in development by MemeBattle today.

### Ligretto

<b>Ligretto</b> â€“ dynamic online multiplayer game, where needed to put cards as soon as possible and outperform opponents with reaction and dexterity.

Play with friends anytime â€“ one round takes only few minutes. Our colleagues spend a free time between meetings sometimes)

### GameHub

<b>GameHub</b> â€“ online games service. Unfortunately there is only one game so far. But in the ideal future it will be the portal of online games in one ecosystem.

Our lives
We are witnessing a profound transformation in people's lives. Whe world is becoming global and remote.
In the past, we used to have the chance to effortlessly gather with friends or colleagues at a party or in the office, enjoy ourselves, and engage in board games.

Nowadays, many companies are spread across the globe, making it more difficult to gather around one table.
GameHub and games within it can facilitate spending time together by playing.

### Blog

This blog. It's not just MemeBattle team news, but

There will be not only news from the MemeBattle team, but also various posts from everyone.
First of all, would like to share technical discoveries and experience. For example, one of next posts planned as description of using variable fonts research in this blog.

### MemeBattle as PaaS

All our projects deployed to self infrastructure on AWS. We have an established practices and solutions for fast services launch to production.

### Education

We continue to use our projects for education. New technologies, tools, approaches etc.

> It's better to try something on real-like projects than read about it a thousand times.

#### Experience

Here, you can practice solving problems like on real-life projects. For example, [add localization system to Ligretto](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/issues/177), so that the language barrier doesn't spoil the gaming experience.
Or add new features like [leaderboard in Ligretto](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/milestone/11).

Also there are smaller tasks that help newcomers take their [first steps](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/labels/good%20first%20issue).

The experience gained from our projects consistently assists me during interviews and in my work.
And because our repositories are open and projects are publicly accessible, any community member has tangible evidence of their experience.

#### Mentoring

Furthermore, I believe that MemeBattle projects provide a solid infrastructure for mentoring.

We are always eager to assist everyone, and if you are a mentor or a buddy, we can support you with tasks. After all, collaborating on a project with others is much more enjoyable than working in isolation.

## Summary

MemeBattle is projects, technical and education platform, team and community. Together we learn new things in practice, and our main resource is people.
