        '## How it all began\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In 2017, a group of students from Novosibirsk State Technical University teamed up to participate in an online hackathon.\n' +
        'The hackathon was dedicated entertainment and fun. We created an application (web and Android) with an endless battle of memes. Every few seconds, users saw a pair of memes and voted for one of them.\n' +
        'Players who rated the meme with a majority vote received the internal currency – MemeCoin.\n' +
        'We won that hackathon and received investments for development.\n' +
        '\n' +

        '</details>\n' +
        '\n' +
        'After that, we participated in hackathons for several years. Local hackathons in Siberia (Tomsk, Kemerovo, Novosibirsk) and large ones in Moscow. It was our hobby.\n' +
        'Meanwhile, we periodically returned to the original idea, but never created a real product 😢\n' +

        '<InstagramPost publicationId="BaRdqExl35J" description="A post shared by Themezv (@artem_zverev.9)" />\n' +
        '\n' +
        'In parallel with hackathons, we have done some educational projects. For example, in union with other students, owe organized the AVTF IT community – several meetups by different streams (web development, mobile development, databases, information security, data science). For you to know, our first meetup brought together more than 150 people!\n' +

        '\n' +
        'We often discussed MemeBattle and told our friends about it. But we have not been able to answer the question "What is MemeBattle". We usually answer like this:\n' +
        '> MemeBattle is not a dot on a map. MemeBattle is people.\n' +

        '<InstagramPost publicationId="BuPCRKrlI4C" description="A post shared by MemeBattle (@memebattle.world)" />\n' +
        '\n' +
        'Looking back, I can answer:\n' +
        '><b>MemeBattle</b> is a small community built around several technical projects that we have used to explore new technologies and approaches. <br /> It is also a team that we created to participate in hackathons and other activities.\n' +
        '\n' +
        '## MemeBattle today\n' +
        '\n' +

        '\n' +
        'At the moment, MemeBattle is primarily an <b>open community</b> united by common projects.\n' +
        'We are open to new ideas and projects and are happy to invite everyone to join us.\n' +

        '[https://mems.fun/](https://mems.fun/)\n' +
        '\n' +
        "We are witnessing a profound transformation in people's lives. The world is becoming global and remote.\n" +

        '#### Experience\n' +

        "Here you can practice solving problems like on real-life projects. For example, [add localization system to Ligretto](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/issues/177), so that the language barrier doesn't spoil the gaming experience.\n" +
        'Or add new features like [leaderboard in Ligretto](https://github.com/MemeBattle/monorepo/milestone/11).\n' +
        '\n' +
