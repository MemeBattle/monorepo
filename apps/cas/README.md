# CAS

CAS (Central Authentication Service) is a centralized authentication and user management service for an ecosystem of applications. It serves as a single Identity Provider (IdP) that allows multiple applications to delegate user authentication and identity management, eliminating the need for each application to implement its own authentication system.
